# Cyber Security Notes

This repo contains write-ups, notes, and small demonstrations related to 
application security, cryptography, and adversarial reasoning!

The goal of this repo is to document the security concepts I encounter clearly, 
with a focus on threat models, assumptions, and why systems fail.

## Topics
- Web security & authentication
- Cryptographic primitives and misuse
- CTF challenge writeups
- Protocol analysis

## Structure
- `writeups/` – security analyses and explanations
- `code/` – small proof-of-concept demos
- `references/` – papers and learning resources

## Disclaimer
All analyses I've completed are performed on intentionally vulnerable or educational systems.
